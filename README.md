Google Chrome's "Coverage" feature allows users to track a site's file usage, such as CSS files. This feature pinpoints which code is used and which is not, providing a JSON file with the tracked data.

My program processes this JSON file and generates new files containing only the used content. Getting the JSON file can be tricky; you might need to shrink, hover, or click certain elements on the site to capture accurate data. Through some trial and error, this program provides direction for processing the file. Despite the ups and downs, Iâ€™m happy with the results.

*I've created a setup and added it to the releases section for easy access.
